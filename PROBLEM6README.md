This module provides a secure, real-time API for managing and displaying the top 10 users’ scores. It is responsible for:

Receiving score update events from the client

Authorizing requests

Updating scores in the database

Broadcasting real-time score changes to connected clients

1. Requirements Covered
#	Requirement
1	Maintain a scoreboard of top 10 users by score
2	Support real-time updates (WebSocket or SSE)
3	Allow score updates when user completes an action
4	Accept backend-triggered API call to increment user score
5	Prevent unauthorized score manipulation (auth, signature validation, etc.)

2. API Design
POST /api/score/update
Update a user’s score after completing an action.

Headers: Authorization: Bearer <JWT>

Body:
{
  "userId": "string",
  "scoreDelta": 5,
  "actionId": "string"
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "newScore": 1200
}

Validation & Protection

JWT auth (prevent impersonation)

actionId is verified against a unique action log or nonce (prevent replay attack)

Input sanitization

3. Real-Time Scoreboard Updates
Use WebSockets (Socket.IO or native) or SSE to push updates to clients.

Clients subscribe to the top 10 scoreboard list.

When a score changes, server:

Updates database

Recomputes top 10

Emits scoreboard:update event with payload:
{
  "topUsers": [
    { "username": "Alice", "score": 1500 },
    ...
  ]
}

4. Database Schema (simplified)
Table: users
- id UUID (PK)
- username TEXT
- score INTEGER DEFAULT 0
- last_action_id UUID

Table: scores_log
- id UUID (PK)
- user_id UUID (FK)
- action_id UUID (unique)
- delta INTEGER
- created_at TIMESTAMP

5. Flow Diagram
[Frontend Action Completed]
          |
          V
[POST /api/score/update]  ← JWT + actionId required
          |
[Auth Middleware]
          |
[Verify actionId not reused]
          |
[Update user's score]
          |
[Recalculate top 10 if needed]
          |
[Push new scores to all clients via WebSocket]

6. Improvements / Additional Comments
Rate Limiting — Prevent spam requests from user/browser.

Action Signature — Sign action payload with secret to verify action is legit.

Caching — Use Redis to cache and quickly broadcast top 10 users.

Analytics Hook — Optional integration to log each score update for monitoring.
